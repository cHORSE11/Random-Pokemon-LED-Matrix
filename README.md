I used a [ Waveshare 64x32 display](https://www.waveshare.com/rgb-matrix-p3-64x32.htm)(any pitch works), and a [ M4 Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745). 

I'll be making a tutorial video soon but for now just follow these instructions.

5. Drag and drop your citcuit python file into the shortcut (or the device that shows up in your file explorer if you're on windows). Your device should now be named CIRCUTPY instead of its original name
6. Copy and paste code from the
